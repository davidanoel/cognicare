# The CogniCare Collective 🧠

CogniCare is a professional mental health platform that empowers counselors with advanced AI-assisted tools for client assessment, treatment planning, and progress monitoring. Powered by [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs), CogniCare leverages a specialized chain of AI agents to enhance clinical decision-making and streamline practice management.

## Core AI Implementation

### 🤖 AI Agent Chain
